## Welcome

Hi there, I'm Prajwal!

Welcome to Making Cents, a site where I share my musings and experiences on various topics that interest me. In general, just making sense of life.

Personally that means thoughts and background across a lot of interests: magic, books, shows, climbing, Krav Maga, canyoneering, hiking, finance, real estate, and personal productivity.

Professionally, I plan to share the wealth of experience and knowledge I’ve gained working in analytics, consulting, and development over the past decade here as well!

On both fronts, I look forward to documenting the learning process as I tackle new and exciting challenges!

I’m hoping that my stories and learnings can help you navigate your own journey, personal or professional. Connect with me on social media if you have any questions!
